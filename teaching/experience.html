            <p>
                I possess vast experience in teaching from high school to the university level, from online/remote teaching to in person teaching, from small-class teaching to large-class teaching.   
            </p> 
            <p> 
                Under this program, I was teaching the subject of thermodynamics, and other subjects were led by other volunteers. There were about 60 students, who took thermodynamics with different instructors on campus, participated in my weekly tutorial classes.

                My Teaching Philosophy 
            </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I do not see students as “the least experienced group”. In fact, I believe they are the backbone of education as they have the abilities to view things from different angles, introduce fresh ideas, foster innovation, and incorporate creativity. I strike to empower vulnerable young students in my classrooms and help them discover their full potential such that they can see themselves as valuable assets in their future organizations. As an educator, I believe that it is also important to demonstrate my personal vulnerability to students by seeking their opinions, learning from them, and acknowledging things that are outside of my expertise.
