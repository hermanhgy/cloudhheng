            <p>
                I was serving as a lab demonstrator during my <a href="../education/MSc.html">M.Sc.</a> program. The labs that I have taught were mainly in the area of fluid mechanics, including wind energy lab, which was performed outdoor, and flow measurement lab which was performed in a wind tunnel. The lab was designed to help students strengthen their understanding in the engineering subjects of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Being a lab demonstrator during my M.Sc. program is also part of the reasons why I enrolled in a professional course - <a href="../professional/GPS989.html">Philosophy and Practice of University Teaching</a> to seek continuous opportunites for improvements in teaching.
            </p>

            <h3>
                My Evaluation for This Lab

            <hr>

            <p>
                The figure below shows a voluntary survey answered by my students about the overall quality of the lab conducted. 94% of the students have rated the lab conducted was "very good" or "good".
