    <p>
        I highly value giving back to the community and reaching out to the vulnerable people, so community involvement has been part of my life for more than 10 years. It is part of my mission statement to guide more people to discover their goals, values and strengths, and volunteering in the community offers lots of opportunities for me to execute this mission. After all, it is also a great opportunity to grow leadership skills and enhance professional development. Moreover, my volunteer experience often contributes to my wellness; having some fun time with the community is a way for me to exercise life balance by experiencing a different social lifestyle after work.

    <h3>
        My Principles of Leadership
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Leadership is a continuous journey, but not a destination. It is important to identify one's own leadership philosophy that can help create mutual benefits between myself and my community. For this reason, I outline three core principles that guide my leadership actions when leading events and activities in my community as follows: 
    </p>
    
    <h6>
        Casting vision and setting goals
    </h6>
    <p>
        Clear goals lead to effective and appropriate actions. When leading events, often there is a challenge of executing multiple actions with limited resources. By having solid goals and understand what should be achieved, the team can get a clearer picture on what to prioritize and avoid spending unnecessary effort. My objective-approach strategy also assists me in evaluation processes where feedback is gathered to assess if the goals were met. If found to not be met, the set goals can even be motivators to trigger innovative and creative solutions that address the root cause of not meeting the goals.
    </p> 

    <h6>
        Creating platforms for people
    </h6>
    <p>
        In line with my <a href="../teaching/philosophy.html">teaching philosophy statement</a>, every person is unique due to their distinct backgrounds. For this reason, each person is expected to have their own unique talents and strengths. Hence, I pledge to utilize community events as platforms to discover different talents in my community and determine how their stengths can be utilized. This is particularly important for young people who are still exploring their own interests and strengths. By giving young people more platforms and opportunities to perform, they identify their values. This can greatly motivate them to invest more efforts and time in growing their strengths. I believe leading youth to discover their values and strengths is the key to reduce criminal activities in communities.  
    </p>

    <h6>
        Committing to continuous learning 
    </h6>
    <p>
        It is important to continuously enhance my knowledge in order to better serve my community. Leading events often involves a lot of communication with people of various backgrounds and talents. People from various disciplines have their unique requirements, and it is common for people to seek understanding from leaders. Deepening my knowledge in more fields helps me connect with each team that has different expertise so that I can challenge myself to integrate different requirements from each team towards the same goal. After all, it is also my belief that education is an effective tool to help vulnerable people in my community to escape from poverty.
