                I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at McGill University. Many times, when I explain my research, people respond with, “That doesn’t sound like mechanical engineering.” And they’re right. While my program is in mechanical engineering, and I am a fully licensed engineer in Canada practicing in the mechanical engineering discipline, I do not define myself solely by that title. I believe that solving real-world challenges requires expertise beyond a single discipline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I also envision myself as a scientist rather than restricting myself to the label of a “mechanical engineer” confined to purely mechanical work. I embrace an interdisciplinary approach to drive innovation and strongly value collaboration, which is a key aspect of my current research. Multidisciplinarity is essential for addressing complex global challenges, and I strive to integrate knowledge from various fields to develop innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Ph.D. research focuses on combustion, specifically investigating the science and physics of novel <b>metal-fuel combustion</b>. Metal as a fuel? If this concept sounds new (or even unbelievable), I invite you to read more!

                The challenges of using renewable energy sources 
            </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We all know that the energy crisis and reducing carbon emissions are among the most pressing challenges today. But why is it so difficult to transition to renewable energy sources and achieve large-scale decarbonization? This is a question I often receive from those outside the engineering field.
            </p>
            <p>
                The challenge is not that we lack renewable energy sources—there is abundant solar energy in deserts and plentiful wind energy offshore. Instead, there are two major obstacles:
                <ul>
                    <li> Intermittency – Renewable energy is not always available. For instance, solar power is more abundant in the summer and significantly lower in the winter. However, in the 21st century, people expect continuous and reliable access to energy throughout the year.</li>
                    <li> Geographical Distribution – Renewable energy sources are unevenly distributed across the globe as demonstrated by the map below from the Global Wind/Solar Atlas. What if people living in regions with low renewable energy potential (blue regions on the map) also need access to renewable power?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                We need energy storage! 
            </h3>
            <hr>

            <p>
                Based on the challenges above, what if we can <b>'move'</b> the renewable energy around the globe? We cannot move the wind and solar power of course, but we can convert them into electrcity and 'move' the electricity. That is great, but still not practical as we may need to build very long electrical tranmissions lines connecting the regions with high renewable energy sources to the location with low renewable energy sources. That doesn't sound practical and it definitely involve a high cost. 
            </p>

            <p>
                What about if we <b>store</b> renewable energy instead? Electrical energy cannot be stored (once you produce it, you must use it). But we can convert these renewable energy into chemical energy instead! And this chemical energy can be moved around too! Most simple example - batteries. It is chemical energy and you can use it on demand. But why batteries cannot still solve the energy crisis problem? It is because batteries have a very low energy density - you will need a very heavy and large battery if you would like to do more energy-demanded work like heating, which is not practical too.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Another solutions is hydrogen! 
            </p>

            <p>
                My Ph.D. research proposes a relatively new solution - metal fuels. Just like it is possible to use renewable energy (e.g. solar, wind) to reduce water (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen, and use hydrogen as a fuel, we can also reduce metal oxides (e.g. Al2O3, Fe2O3) into metal (Al, Fe) and oxygen and use metal as a fuel! In other words, we are storing the energy from solar and wind in the metal in the form of chemical energy. And metals can be moved around easily - means we can move this stored renewable energy around without needing the long transmission lines! So we call metals as energy carrier!   
            </p>

            <p>
                Think about metal fuels like a 'better version of battery' where you can move around it with a much larger energy density. Below is an illustration if aluminum and iron metals are used as an energy carrier, how small the size can be compared to battery and hydrogen, for the same energy output.    
            </p>

            <h3>
                Metal Fuels 
            </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                What makes metal interesting is also it is a carbon-free fuels. If we burn metal (e.g. Al), we get metal oxides (e.g. Al2O3) without greenhouse gas emissions. Since the products of combustion is metal oxides in solid state, the combustion products can be captured and reycled. Then, these metal oxides can be reduced back to pure metal to be used over and over again in a closed sustainable loop as shown below. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the research on metal fuels have been focusing on aluminum and iron fuels. I take the challenge to investigate a new metal fuel - silicon combustion. What makes silicon interesting is that it is the second most abundant element in the world (after oxygen). It is a promising energy carrier but the combustion physics and chemistry are not well known. During my Ph.D. program, I created a research program that successfully stabilize silicon flames, which allow us to investigate its combustion behaviours (some publications are coming - stay tune :)

                Common Myths about Metal Fuels
            </h3>
            <p>
                Metal fuels are a fascinating innovation, but as a relatively new concept, misconceptions about their role as energy carriers are common. Based on my experiences at various international conferences and interactions with people outside the field, here are some frequently asked questions about metal fuels.

                        How can metals burn easily and serve as a fuel? We use metal components everywhere — in cellphones, hardware, and other devices — yet those things do not seem to burn rapidly (if we ignite them).

                            Since metal fuels exist in a solid state, the reaction rate depends on the size of the metal particles. For metals to burn effectively and generate a reasonable amount of power, the particles should be micron-sized.

                        Metals like aluminum and silicon are very energy-intensive to produce. If we consider the entire life cycle of metal fuels, doesn’t this make them an unsustainable option?

                            Yes, some metals require a significant amount of energy to produce. However, metal fuels are used for energy storage. The more renewable energy (solar, wind) used in their production, the more renewable energy is stored within the metal. This means that when the metal is later used for combustion, you recover the same high amount of energy that was initially stored. That’s what makes metal fuels so interesting!

                        To produce metals from reduction, we need electrolysis (which requires electricity) or hydrogen as a reducing agent. Why not just use electricity or hydrogen directly for energy applications instead of using them for metal production?

                            The purpose of metal fuels is to store energy and transport it as an energy carrier. We can think about why do we need a power bank — we first charge it with electricity and then use it to power our devices on demand. Why not use electricity (which charges the power bank) directly? Because we need energy storage!
                            <br><br>
                            Electricity cannot be stored directly. Hydrogen stores energy chemically, but requires large storage space and poses safety risks such as leakage. Metal fuels can be seen as a 'power bank' - they store energy efficiently and can be easily transported and used as needed.
