                I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at McGill University. Many times, when I explain my research, people respond with, “That doesn’t sound like mechanical engineering.” And they’re right. While my program is in mechanical engineering, and I am a fully licensed engineer in Canada practicing in the mechanical engineering discipline, I do not define myself solely by that title. I believe that solving real-world challenges requires expertise beyond a single discipline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I also envision myself as a scientist rather than restricting myself to the label of a “mechanical engineer” confined to purely mechanical work. I embrace an interdisciplinary approach to drive innovation and strongly value collaboration, which is a key aspect of my current research. Multidisciplinarity is essential for addressing complex global challenges, and I strive to integrate knowledge from various fields to develop innovative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                My Ph.D. research focuses on combustion, specifically investigating the science and physics of novel <b>metal-fuel combustion</b>. Metal as a fuel? If this concept sounds new (or even unbelievable), I invite you to read more!

                The challenges of using renewable energy sources 
            </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We all know that the energy crisis and reducing carbon emissions are among the most pressing challenges today. But why is it so difficult to transition to renewable energy sources and achieve large-scale decarbonization? This is a question I often receive from those outside the engineering field.
            </p>
            <p>
                The challenge is not that we lack renewable energy sources—there is abundant solar energy in deserts and plentiful wind energy offshore. Instead, there are two major obstacles:
                <ul>
                    <li> Intermittency – Renewable energy is not always available. For instance, solar power is more abundant in the summer and significantly lower in the winter. However, in the 21st century, people expect continuous and reliable access to energy throughout the year.</li>
                    <li> Geographical Distribution – Renewable energy sources are unevenly distributed across the globe as demonstrated by the map below from the Global Wind/Solar Atlas. What if people living in regions with low renewable energy potential (blue regions on the map) also need access to renewable power?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <b>Project Title</b>: Waste Prediction and Life Cycle Assessment of Wind Turbine Blades in Canada   
            </p>
            <p>
                During the 2nd year of my M.Sc. degree, I was fortunate to be funded by <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/en">Mitacs Canada</a> to participate in a research exchange program with the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/">University of Nottingham</a> in the UK. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The research predicted the cumulative wind turbine blade waste until 2050 in Canada due to the rapid development of wind power and assessed their waste management strategies. While the wind power is a clean energy technology, it introduces waste especially during the decommissioning and waste management process. A long-term forecast on the waste due to the wind power sector is needed for each provincial government to plan for their renewable energy policies and waste management programs.

                My life at the U of S

                Personally, I think Saskatoon offers a perfect study environment. Being relatively less populated compared to other major cities in Canada, the city offers some benefits, from shorter transit time between home and the campus to having more sense of community. Of course, the views in the prairie during the summer are also stunning, if you are someone who sometimes values a quiet space &#128521;
            </p>
            <p>
                Living in the prairie has helped me learn more about the First Nations, which is part of the <a href="https://teaching.usask.ca/indigenoussk/import/indigenous_peoplesof_saskatchewan.php">indigenous people</a> in Canada. Besides visiting their forest on their Treaty Day, I also had the opportunity to introduce Engineering studies to some First Nations high school students. This city is small but vibrant with many young students, including international students coming from about 130 countries.
