            This is research of my <a href="MSc.html">M.Sc. degree</a> and it mainy focuses on bluff-body aerodyanamics. Bluff bodies are objects in non-streamlined shapes with applications in many engineering structures such as buildings, offshore structures, bridges, automobiles, etc. The research uses a simple square prism as a bluff-body, and adopted experimental approaches to investigate the effect of structural dimensions, incoming wind directions and turbulence intensity on the pressure distribution on the top surface of the prism. The experiments were conducted in a wind tunnel at the <a href="https://engineering.usask.ca/departments/mech.php#AbouttheDepartment">Department of Mechanical Engineering</a>, University of Saskatchewan.

                With engineering knowledge, we know the drag force of bluff bodies is significantly larger than streamlined bodies due to a larger low pressure region at the downstream of bluff bodies. But if we compare between the drag force of bluff bodies, have you ever wonder what shape would result in a larger drag force? The experiment shows the drag force (expressed as <i>C<sub>D</sub></i>) of square-shaped bluff bodies is significantly larger than the circular shape. This experiment also investigate the vortex shedding frequency of different bluff bodies, a parameter which may result in flow induced vibration. The shedding frequency is expressed as Strohaul number (St), and it can be observed that the shedding frequency of the cylinder is the largest.

                Significance of the Research

                The information on the pressure field on the top surface is essential for determining the wind loading and regions of disturbed flow with unnecessary vorticities. For buildings in particular, information on the rooftop pressure distribution and regions of disturbed flow are needed to properly locate heating and air conditioning units, intake and exhaust ducts, rooftop solar panels, small wind turbines, and other equipment. Proper location of these devices, outside regions of disturbed flow and in a favorable pressure environment, is needed to maximize performance and minimize energy costs. This research enables design engineers to better understand how the building geometry and wind direction may influence the pressure distribution and the aerodynamic forces on a building or offshore structure. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another environmental benefits which could be derived from this research is the investigation of the pollutant flow. For different shapes and a wide range of structural geometries, wind directions, and wind conditions, 
                the research outcomes can also be used to predict the directions of pollutants generated at the rooftops (such as chimneys) after fluid-structure interaction, and if these harmful pollutants will reach the ground level and jeopardize public health.
            </p>
            <p> 
                This research has filled some identified literature gaps, by providing extensive information on the top-surface pressure distribution of square prisms for a wider range of structural dimensions and wind directions, compared to previously published studies.
