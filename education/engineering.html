            <p>
                Whichever program you choose, you can expect to study a series of general engineering subjects in your first year. This means every engineering student, regardless of their programs of choice, will most likely take the same courses in the first year. These courses include but are not limited to:
            </p>

                    As an engineering student, you can expect to learn a lot of calculus for 3 to 4 terms because it is a mathematical subject often used in engineering applications. There are two major components in Calculus:
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Differentiation:</u>
                    When it comes to engineering analysis, engineers are often interested in rates of change. We need to differentiate how a parameter changes with respect to one or more other parameters. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a car is moving, how fast is the speed changing with time? This would determine the acceleration of the car.</li>
                        <li>If water is flowing in a pipe, how does the temperature of the water change across the pipe?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <u>Integration:</u>
                    Integration is the reverse of differentiation where you accumulate a parameter at every single data point with respect to another parameter and yield the total.                    <ul>
                        <li>If you know the speed of a car at every distance data point, you can integrate its speed and obtain total distance travelled by the car.</li>
                        <li>In your car engine's cylinder, if you know the air pressure at every single volume data point, you can integrate the pressure to obtain the total work done by your engine.</li>
                    </ul>  
                    <!-- I personally observe many first year engineering students find the calculus is too difficult and that could be a reason for the high drop out rate in some engineering schools. 
                    We actually have to recognize that Calculus often uses arbitrary parameters like x, y, z, and therefore you may not able to appreciate engineering quickly. 
                    In the real world, that x, y, z can be any engineering parameters like pressure, volume, time, temperature, distance etc which are closely related to your field.
                    This means you might need to go further to your second or third year in order for you to fully appreciate engineering.               -->

Of course, when entering universities, these subjects would be learned in a much deeper manner. Some schools require students to take these general science subjects as mandatory courses while some schools may offer them as electives. There are also some schools that may require their students to study physics that are more related to their programs, e.g. Physics of Electricity and Magnetism for electrical engineering students.

                    Engineering Mechanics is a subject area closely related to Civil and Mechanical Engineering. The concepts of statics are introduced, i.e. a series of mechanics that involves the analysis of forces and moments in order to achieve a static-equilibrium state. This is an important concept in engineering to ensure structural safety. Some schools also offer dynamics, an opposite concept of statics with a strong focus on motion, as a general first year subject. If you like these subjects, chances are you would appreciate Civil or Mechanical Engineering. 
                    <br><br>
                    However, why are these subjects usually offered as first year common engineering subjects for all disciplines including Electrical or Chemical Engineering? Well, it is also common for Mechanical Engineering students to take some basic Electrical Engineering courses like circuit analysis. Engineering studies often involve lots of interdisciplinary areas. When it comes to an engineering project, often we are dealing with many other engineers from other disciplines. In order to communicate effectively with as many people as possible in engineering context, it is recommended to learn some basic subjects outside of our fields as well.

                I personally appreciate these first-year general engineering courses because it allows students to take some time to explore their interests. Since everyone is studying the same courses, you get to explore a little bit on many general topics and then determine your passion. I personally took physics in three different areas (mechanics, electricity, modern physics) and finally found out Mechanical Engineering suits me the most.

                Many schools allow their students to choose their programs at the end of their first year,
                so take full advantage of this first year to decide what suits you the most. Please note that some programs may be competitive and often offered with certain quota. Therefore, it is common for schools to enroll students into their preferred choices of program based on their first-year academic performance.

                <b>How do I Know if Engineering is for Me?</b>

            <p>
                Choosing a university program is an important life decision. Even when one has decided to pursue an engineering degree, there is also the next step of determining which engineering program to pursue. Moreover, within an engineering program, there are still many areas in which you can choose to specialize. These decisions can be tough, but doubts and uncertainties can often be reduced with proper consultation and detailed self-examination. Below are some factors that could be your reference in deciding if pursuing an engineering degree is a suitable option for you.

            <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
                Every path that you choose in your life will likely come with challenges. However, challenges can often be faced in a positive attitude if you are motivated and driven by your passion and interests. Engineers solve the real daily life challenges faced by today's society, so Engineering studies often involve a lot of design problems which require creative thinking and complex mathematical analysis. Some questions you could reflect on are:
                <ul style="margin-left: 15px;">
                    <li>Do you enjoy mathematical calculations?</li>
                    <li>Are you eager to find out how things work?</li>
                    <li>Are you passionate in finding new innovative solutions to existing problems?</li>
                </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
                As discussed above, engineering studies may involve some interdisciplinary studies. This means you would likely learn a few subject areas outside your major regardless of your program of choice. In engineering work environments, it is common to use team work to communicate with other engineers of different disciplines. Having more knowledge in other engineering disciplines could allow you to communicate more effectively in a team. Some questions you could reflect on are:

                Many people study Engineering because they think there will be a bright future such as earning a big salary. I personally disagree with this motivation. Spend a moment to reflect, what would you do if engineering is less blooming than you expected in the future (e.g. unexpected global oil price drop)? Are you willing to drop your engineering career and pursue another area from scratch? It is reasonable to have "big earning" as a motivation, but I suggest not to have this as your sole reason of pursuing any degree. Some questions you could reflect on are: 
                <ul style="margin-left: 15px;">
                    <li>What is your main driver to pursue engineering studies?</li>
                    <li>How can that driver motivate you even when you are facing critical challenges in your engineering studies or career?</li>
                </ul>
